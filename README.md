## Disclaimer
This package is still a work in progress. Some bugs could remain and there are some norm errors that aren't detected yet. If you find a bug, don't hesitate to create an issue on GitHub or to write a pull request !

## Config
* Auto Check Norm: Auto activate the norm linter. Warning, this option could slow down your editor, some optimizations are still necessary.

## Todo
* Detect missing norm errors on .c source files.
* Detect errors on .h source files.
* Adapt the plugin to Makefiles.
